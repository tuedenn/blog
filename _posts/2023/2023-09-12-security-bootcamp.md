From September 08 to 10, in Da Nang, Vietnam, the 10th anniversary of the Security Bootcamp Conference took place. This is the leading event in Vietnam on Cyber Security, with the mission of building and connecting the community of cybersecurity professionals nationwide to share the latest knowledge and skills, creating a reputable and quality conference for cybersecurity in Vietnam.

I participated in Security Bootcamp 2023 as a Conference speaker as well as a contestant in the Cyber Arena competition. I present on the topic **"Maximum your DFIR value with minimum cost"** (*heavily inspired by SANS SEC450, FOR508&608*) with the desire to show everyone the value of DFIR and propose ideas so that organizations can easily take the advantage of open source tools such as Velociraptor to strengthen the defense capabilities.
